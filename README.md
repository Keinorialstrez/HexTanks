# HexTanks
This is an experimental project made using a C# and Unity 3D. This game is using hexagons and have very specific movement script. I try to make it an interesting, but now it`s not final version, because it need some optimization and maybe some more comfortable movement script. 

Here placed only scripts and apk file because i can`t download a full project on GitHub, sorry for that 

I past here a link to Google Drive with an full project archive if you need that. https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KYQf4JefrGdy9Eug1VA5NxnaxGuSnwfG/view?usp=sharing
